 About Safari-Freight

Our Brand Story

Safari-Freight was born from a passion for making logistics simpler and more reliable across Africa. What started as a small idea to help local businesses move goods more efficiently has now grown into a trusted name in regional and international freight services. We believe logistics should empower growth, not slow it down — and that's exactly what we set out to do.

Who We Serve

We proudly serve a wide range of clients — from small business owners and e-commerce startups to large manufacturers and import/export companies. Whether you're moving one package or an entire shipment, we’re here to deliver.

How We Operate

Safari-Freight combines technology with human service. We track every shipment in real time, communicate transparently, and partner with trusted carriers to ensure your cargo arrives safely, affordably, and on time. Our system is optimized for both road and sea freight, with planned expansion into air logistics.

The Face of Our Business

Behind Safari-Freight is a passionate team of logistics experts, software developers, and customer care professionals. Our founder, Roy Murimi, began the journey after seeing the logistical challenges local businesses faced firsthand — and built Safari-Freight to change that.
